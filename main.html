	<h1> "Time, Space, Complexity" </h1>
	 <p>
		Time complexity is a measure of how the running 
		time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input grows.
		It is a fundamental concept in computer science used to analyze 
		and compare the efficiency of different algorithms.  Efficiency, in this context, refers to how well an algorithm utilizes computational resources, particularly time, to produce a result efficient.
	  </p>
		  <p> <b>Space Complexity:</b>  is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program. In simple terms, any program’s space complexity is calculated by the total amount of space it occupies in the computer’s memory. So when we calculate space complexity, we take into account all the inputs of the program as well as the auxiliary space used. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).
