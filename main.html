	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a measure of how the running 
		time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input grows.
		It is a fundamental concept in computer science used to analyze 
		and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. Efficiency, in this context, refers to how well an algorithm utilizes computational resources, particularly time, to produce a result efficient.
	</p>
	<p><b> Space complexity</b>of O(n) denotes Linear <b>Space Complexity</b>. This means that the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to execute grows in a direct, linear proportion to the size of its input, represented by 'n'.
